# BetterUntis iOS

A native iOS implementation of BetterUntis - an alternative mobile client for the Untis timetable system.

## Overview

This iOS version provides a clean, native Swift implementation of the BetterUntis app with SwiftUI for modern iOS experiences. It maintains feature parity with the Android version while leveraging iOS-specific capabilities.

## Features

- **Modern SwiftUI Interface** - Clean, native iOS design following Apple's Human Interface Guidelines
- **Custom WeekView Component** - Smooth, interactive timetable display optimized for iOS
- **Multi-Account Support** - Secure management of multiple Untis accounts using Keychain
- **Info Center** - Messages, homework, exams, and absence management
- **RoomFinder** - Find available rooms by date and time
- **Offline Caching** - Core Data integration for offline timetable access
- **Background Refresh** - Keep timetables updated automatically

## Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **SwiftUI** - Modern declarative UI framework
- **Core Data** - Local data persistence and caching
- **URLSession** - Native HTTP networking for Untis API communication
- **Keychain Services** - Secure credential storage
- **AVFoundation** - QR code scanning for easy login setup

### Architecture Pattern
- **MVVM** - Model-View-ViewModel pattern with SwiftUI
- **Repository Pattern** - Data access abstraction layer
- **Combine** - Reactive programming for data flow

## Key Components

### WeekView Component
The heart of the app - a custom SwiftUI component that displays the weekly timetable:
- Smooth scrolling in both directions
- Touch interaction for period details
- Time-based layout with proper scaling
- Color-coded periods matching Untis data
- Responsive design for different screen sizes

### UntisAPIClient
Handles all communication with Untis servers:
- JSON-RPC API calls with comprehensive fallback system
- Authentication management (app shared secrets, auth tokens)
- Support for older WebUntis servers (automatic method detection)
- Error handling and network resilience
- Async/await pattern for modern Swift
- 15+ fallback methods for maximum compatibility

### Data Management
- **Core Data** for local storage and caching
- **Repository pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Keychain** for secure credential storage
- Smart caching with timestamp-based invalidation

### Authentication Flow
1. School search and selection
2. Username/password authentication OR QR code scanning
3. App shared secret generation
4. Secure credential storage in Keychain
5. Multi-account support with easy switching

### QR Code Login
- Native camera integration for WebUntis QR codes
- Automatic URL parsing and validation
- Seamless login setup without manual entry
- Simulator-safe implementation with proper error handling

## Setup and Installation

### Requirements
- iOS 15.0+
- Xcode 15.0+
- Swift 5.9+

### Dependencies
```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/apple/swift-collections.git", from: "1.2.1")
```
The app uses native iOS frameworks (URLSession, Core Data, SwiftUI) with minimal external dependencies.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `BetterUntis.xcodeproj` in Xcode
3. Ensure all dependencies are resolved
4. Build and run on iOS Simulator or device

## API Compatibility

This iOS version maintains full compatibility with the Untis WebUntis API:
- JSON-RPC 2.0 protocol
- All authentication methods (getAppSharedSecret, getAuthToken)
- Timetable data fetching (getTimetable2017, getPeriodData2017) with extensive fallbacks
- Info center endpoints (getMessagesOfDay2017, getHomeWork2017, getExams2017)
- Master data synchronization (getClasses, getTeachers, getSubjects, getRooms)
- Student absence management (getStudentAbsences2017)

### Legacy Server Support
The app includes comprehensive fallback mechanisms for older WebUntis servers:
- **Timetable**: 6+ fallback methods including `getLessons`, `getTimetableForElement`
- **Messages**: Fallbacks to `getMessages`, `getNewsOfDay`
- **Homework**: Fallbacks to `getHomework`, `getHomeworks`
- **Rooms**: Fallbacks to `getRoomList`, `getAllRooms`
- **Exams**: Fallbacks to `getExaminations`, `getTests`
- **Absences**: Fallbacks to `getStudentAbsences`, `getAbsences`

This ensures compatibility with servers from different WebUntis versions dating back several years.

## Recent Improvements

### v1.0 Highlights
- **Core Data Schema Fix**: Resolved app crashes related to optional field mismatches
- **Enhanced API Compatibility**: Added support for very old WebUntis servers (e.g., mese.webuntis.com)
- **QR Code Implementation**: Full QR code scanning with camera permissions and error handling
- **Robust Error Handling**: Comprehensive fallback mechanisms for network failures
- **Memory Management**: Optimized Core Data operations and reduced memory footprint

### Troubleshooting

#### Older WebUntis Servers
If you're experiencing issues with older WebUntis installations:
1. The app automatically detects and uses fallback API methods
2. Check the console logs for API method attempts
3. Some servers may only support basic methods like `getLessons`

#### QR Code Scanning
- Ensure camera permissions are granted in iOS Settings
- QR codes should follow the WebUntis format: `untis://setschool?url=...&school=...`
- Scanning works on physical devices; simulators show a permission prompt
